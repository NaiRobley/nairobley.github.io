## Introduction

Web scraping is a technique employed to extract a large amount of data from websites and format it for use in a variety of applications. Web scraping allows us to automatically extract data and present it in a usable configuration, or process and store the data elsewhere. The data collected can also be part of a pipeline where it is treated as an input for other programs.

In the past, extracting information from a website meant copying the text available on a web page manually. This method is highly inefficient and not scalable. These days, there are some nifty packages in Python that will help us automate the process! In this post, I'll walk through some use cases for web scraping, highlight the most popular open source packages, and walk through an example project to scrape publicly available data on Github.


## Web Scraping Use Cases

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Manuel83/sample/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

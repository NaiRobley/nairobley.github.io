# Personal Blog. 

This is a simple, beautiful and swift personal blog built using [Jalpc Theme](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It's mobile first, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.


## Packages & Integrations

I use the following packages in the website to meet various needs:

- [Google analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to achieve web analytics.

- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments on the blog posts.

- [AddToAny](https://www.addtoany.com/) to share the blog posts on other social network platforms.

- [jPages](http://luis-almeida.github.io/jPages) for pagination since jekyll pagination does not meet all my needs.

- [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) to show skills on a chart on the landing page.

## Search engine

I use javascript to implement blog search, you can double click `Ctrl` or click the icon at lower right corner of the page.

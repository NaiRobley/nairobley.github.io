  desc: A software developer driven by passion, excellence and the belief that the future will be written in code.
    I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects and technologies that require me to work outside my comfort-zone
    and knowledge set, as continuing to learn and overcome challenges fuel my growth. I am passionate about big data and analytics.
